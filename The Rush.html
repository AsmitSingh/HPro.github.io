     <h1>The Rush</h1>

      <p>

        In this rush and roar of life,<br>

        where there is no time to think.<br>

        In the world takenover by strife,<br>
 
        and humanity standing on it's brink.<br>

        There was an old woman, and what do you think?<br>

        She lived upon nothing but victuals, and drink;<br>
